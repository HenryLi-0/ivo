interactable visual objects

![](image.png)

A state-based UI/GUI framework using a `tkinter` window system!

This is v2 of the system behind [Tape](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/tape/) and [Protoplop](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/protoplop/), which was isolated and given a name so that I dont spend another three hours running around the code with a sledgehammer!

### Getting Started:

First, make sure you have all the neccesary python modules installed to run this! (Any modules that don't come with python are listed below!) Then, either clone this repository, or download a recent release from the releases tab, and run [`main.py`](/main.py)! Most of the docs are inside the code! Head to [`subsystems/interface.py`](/subsystems/interface.py), [`subsystems/section/`](/subsystems/section/), and [`settings.py`](/settings.py) to get started coding!

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
